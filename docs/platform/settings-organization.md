## Where to Find This

### 2. Members Table

The table contains the following columns:

#### Name

- Your account is marked with **"(You)"** next to your name.
- Each user entry provides a quick way to verify user identity via email.

#### Role
Indicates the assigned user role within the organization.

- **Admin**: Full access to manage settings, users, and integrations.
- **Editor**: Can create and modify items but may not manage users.
- **Viewer**: Read-only access across the platform.

#### Status
Displays the user's current status in the organization.

- **Active**: User has accepted the invitation and can access the platform.
- **Pending**: Invitation link has been sent to a new user in the organization.
- **Invitation Expired**: The invite link sent to the user has expired. The admin can re-invite the user.

#### Actions
An ellipsis (`...`) menu appears for each user (except for your own account) to perform further actions, such as:

- Remove user

*Note*: Only Admin will be allowed to make these changes.

## Inviting Members

### Invite Members Button

Located at the top-right of the screen.

**To invite a new member:**
1. Click the **"Invite Members"** button.
2. Enter the user's email and assign a role(editor or viewer).
3. Send the invite.

The invited user will appear in the members list with a status like "Pending" or "Invitation Expired" depending on whether they've accepted the invite.

---

## Additional Notes

- Only Admins can invite, remove, or update roles of other members.
- If a user’s invitation expires, you can use the ellipsis menu to resend the invite.
- Changes to user roles take effect immediately.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If the "Invite Members" button is not visible, verify that your account has Admin privileges.
