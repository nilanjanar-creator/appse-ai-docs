# Flow Triggers

Flow triggers are built-in tools designed to initiate workflows in APPSe AI. They act as the entry point for workflow execution by capturing events or conditions defined by the user. Once a trigger node is activated, it starts the workflow and passes the relevant data to the connected downstream nodes for further processing.  

Flow triggers always appear at the beginning of a workflow and cannot have any incoming connections.

**`Note:`** Flow triggers do not include App triggers, these are built-in tools from APPSe AI.

- A workflow must have at least one trigger node to be executable.   
- Some flow triggers may require credentials to authenticate with external applications (e.g., when listening for events from a third-party system). Others, such as manual triggers, may not need any credentials.
