# Action Nodes 

The action nodes are an assortment of built-in tools that perform a wide range of activities primarily revolving around:

1. Fetching data
2. Data transformation

These nodes are different from triggers as they cannot be used at the beginning of a flow. These nodes can be attached to a trigger node or another action or app node.
