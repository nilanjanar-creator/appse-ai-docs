# Change Organization
 
## Introduction
 
The **Change Organization** feature in **appse ai** allows users to switch between different organizations linked to their account. This is especially useful if you are part of multiple organizations and need to work within different workspaces.
 
## Important
 
- Users who have access to **multiple organizations** will see a **'Switch Organization'** option, allowing them to move between organizations easily.
 
- Users who have access to **only one organization** will not see this option, as there is no organization to switch to.
 
## How to Change Organization
 
1. From the sidebar, go to the user panel at the bottom-left. Click the three-dot (⋮) menu next to your profile name and select **Change organization**.
